## Project Context

This documentation covers the complete evolution of the City Maze game project:

### Initial State
- Runtime errors preventing game from loading
- Chaotic Git workflow with everything on main branch
- Build files being tracked in repository
- No organized development process

### Current State
- ✅ Fully functional game with mathematical scoring precision
- ✅ Comprehensive responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ Clean Git workflow with feature branch strategy
- ✅ Protected repository with comprehensive .gitignore
- ✅ Documented development process for future maintenance

### Key Achievements Documented
1. **Fixed critical runtime errors** - Dynamic import syntax issues
2. **Implemented mathematical scoring** - Time-squared degradation system  
3. **Enhanced mobile experience** - Responsive design and touch controls
4. **Organized Git workflow** - Feature branches and proper repository management
5. **Cleaned repository** - Removed build files and implemented protection
6. **Comprehensive documentation** - For future development and maintenance

## Development Timeline

The documentation reflects this development progression:

1. **Crisis Phase** - Runtime errors and broken functionality
2. **Enhancement Phase** - Mathematical scoring and mobile improvements  
3. **Organization Phase** - Git workflow establishment and cleanup
4. **Documentation Phase** - Comprehensive guides for future reference

## Using This Documentation

### For Development
- Follow the Git workflow from the workflow guide
- Reference implementation details when making changes
- Check issue solutions before implementing new features

### For Maintenance
